## Overview

This is a Puppet module to manage the installation and initial configuration
of Atlassian Bamboo, a continuous integration and build server.

* Manages the download and installation of Bamboo
* Manages some pre-installation configuration settings, such as Tomcat ports,
  proxy configuration, Java options
* Manages a bamboo user, group, and home
* Manages a service for Bamboo

This is a fork of [maestrodev/bamboo](https://github.com/maestrodev/puppet-bamboo),
which appears to be dormant.  It includes improvements from other authors as
well, notably, [Simon Croomes](https://github.com/croomes/puppet-bamboo).

This module tries to follow conventions in the
[Confluence](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-confluence),
[Jira](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-jira), and
[Stash](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-stash) modules

## Prerequisites

* nanliu/staging: [http://forge.puppetlabs.com/nanliu/staging](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/nanliu/staging)
* A Java installation (e.g. via [puppetlabs/java](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/java))

## Usage

### Defaults

To have Puppet install Bamboo with the default parameters, declare the
bamboo class:

```puppet
class { 'bamboo': }
```

The `bamboo` class serves as a single "point of entry" for the module.

### Examples

#### Customizations

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  version      => '5.9.7',
  installdir   => '/opt/bamboo',
  home         => '/var/local/bamboo',
  user         => 'bamboo',
  java_home    => '/over/the/rainbow/java',
  download_url => 'https://mirrors.example.com/atlassian/bamboo',
  context_path => 'bamboo',
  proxy        => {
    scheme    => 'https',
    proxyName => 'bamboo.example.com',
    proxyPort => '443',
  },
}
```

#### Context Path

Specifying a `context_path` for instances where Bamboo is being served
from a path (e.g. example.com/bamboo)

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  context_path => 'bamboo',
}
```

This configures the embedded Bamboo Tomcat instance with the context path.

#### Reverse Proxy

For instances where Bamboo is behind a reverse proxy

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  proxy => {
    scheme    => 'https',
    proxyName => 'bamboo.example.com',
    proxyPort => '443',
  },
}
```

This configures the embedded Bamboo Tomcat instance's connector.

The proxy parameter accepts a hash of Tomcat options for configuring the
connector's proxy settings.  Refer to
[Tomcat's documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/proxy-howto.html)
for more information.

#### Installation locations

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  installdir => '/opt/bamboo',
  homedir    => '/opt/local/bamboo',
}
```

#### JVM Tuning

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  java_home    => '/usr/lib/java/custom',
  jvm_xms      => '512m',
  jvm_xmx      => '2048m',
  jvm_permgen  => '512m',
  jvm_opts     => '-Dcustomopt',
}
```

#### Tomcat Tuning

Bamboo's powered by an embedded Tomcat instance, which can be tweaked.

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  tomcat_port        => '9090',
  max_threads        => '256',
  min_spare_threads  => '50',
  connection_timeout => '30000',
  accept_count       => '200',
}
```

## Reference

### Class: `bamboo`

#### Parameters


##### `version`

Default: '5.9.7'

The version of Bamboo to download and install.  Should be in a MAJOR.MINOR.PATH
format.

Refer to [https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download)

##### `extension`

Default: 'tar.gz'

The file extension of the remote archive.  This is typically `.tar.gz`.
Accepts `.tar.gz` or `.zip`

##### `installdir`

Default: '/usr/local/bamboo'

The base directory for extracting/installing Bamboo to.  Note that it will
decompress _inside_ this directory to a directory such as
`atlassian-bamboo-5.9.7/`  So an `installdir` of `/usr/local/bamboo` will
ultimately install Bamboo to `/usr/local/bamboo/atlassian-bamboo-5.9.7/` by
default.

Refer to `manage_installdir` and `appdir`

##### `manage_installdir`

Default: `true`

Boolean.  Whether this module should be responsible for managing the
`installdir`

##### `appdir`

Default: `${installdir}/atlassian-bamboo-${version}`

This is the directory that Bamboo gets extracted to within the 'installdir'

By default, this is a subdirectory with the specific version appended to it.

You might want to customize this if you don't want to use the default
`atlassian-bamboo-${version}` convention.

##### `manage_appdir`

Default: `true`

Boolean.  Whether this module should be responsible for managing the `appdir`

##### `homedir`

Default: '/var/local/bamboo'

The home directory for the Bamboo user.  This path will be managed by this
module, even if `manage_user` is false.

##### `context_path`

Default: '' (empty)

For instances where Bamboo is being served from a sub path, such as
`example.com/bamboo`, where the `context_path` would be `bamboo`

##### `tomcat_port`

Default: '8085'

The HTTP port for serving Bamboo.

##### `max_threads`

Default: '150'

Maps to Tomcat's `maxThreads` HTTP attribute.

Refer to [https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html)

Default: '256m'

Size of the permanent generation heap. Unlikely that you need to tune this.

##### `jvm_opts`

Default: ''

Any custom options to start the JVM with.

##### `jvm_optional`

Default: ''

From Bamboo's default `setenv.sh`:

    Occasionally Atlassian Support may recommend that you set some specific JVM
    arguments.  You can use this variable below to do that.

##### `download_url`

systemd is used and this parameter is set to
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/bamboo.service`

##### `service_template`

Default: $bamboo::params::service_template

Template for the init script/service definition.  The module includes an init
script and systemd service configuration, but you can use your own if you'd
like.  This should refer to a Puppet module template. E.g.
`modulename/bamboo.init.erb`

##### `shutdown_wait`

Default: '20',

Seconds to wait for the Bamboo process to stop. (e.g. service bamboo stop will
wait this interval before attempting to kill the process and returning).

### Other Classes

The following classes are called from the base class.  You shouldn't need to
declare these directly.

* [bamboo::install](manifests/install.pp)
* [bamboo::configure](manifests/configure.pp)
* [bamboo::service](manifests/service.pp)

## Limitations

### Tested Platforms

* el6.x

* Puppet 3.x

If you've used this module on other platforms, please submit a pull request
to add it to this list.

### Bamboo Configuration

This module does not manage the initial setup of Bamboo - the steps that are
done via the web interface once installed and running.  This doesn't _appear_
to be easily managed automatically.  This includes database configuration and
the license.  Ultimately, this configuration is placed in
`${homedir}/bamboo-cfg.xml`.  Contributions are welcome to help manage this.

## Development

Please feel free to raise any issues here for bug fixes. We also welcome
feature requests. Feel free to make a pull request for anything and we make the
effort to review and merge. We prefer with tests if possible.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/joshbeard/puppet-bamboo) is used for testing.
